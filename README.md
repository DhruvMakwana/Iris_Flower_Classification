# Iris_Flower_Classification
</br></br>
The Iris data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
</br></br>The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species. The iris data set is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes.
